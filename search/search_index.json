This page will show you how you can format text with RGB and create gradients. The syntax is very similar to that of the popular core plugin CMI. Using hex codes To specify a single hex colour, type it out like this: {#ff00ff}This text will be bright pink! It behaves in the same way as vanilla format codes. Gradients This is where the real fun starts! LucyCommonLib, and by extension all my plugins, support two types of gradient: RGB RGB is is your \"standard gradient\". You give it two hex codes, it fades between them. {#ff0000>}this text will start as red but fade into yellow!{#ffff00<} You can also specify extra formatting tokens to make the gradient bold, italic, etc. These are the same letters as you'd use in vanilla: {#ff00ff:lo>}this is the same but bold ('l') and italic (o)!{#ffff00<} HSV HSV (not to be confused with HSL) is where things start to get exciting. Instead of fading between red, green and blue, this type fades between two hues, keeping the saturation and value consistent. This creates a nice, uniform look if set up right. It's a little more complicated than RGB. {hsv:00aaff>}this text will be a nice pastel rainbow, isn't that cool?{ff<} Let's break this down. First of all, what does 00aaff mean? It helps to have an understanding of how hexadecimal works for this part. Each value here is a two-digit hexadecimal number, in the range of (decimal) 0-255. 00 - the hue to start at aa - the saturation of the gradient ff - the value of the gradient The number in the closing tag is the hue to finish at. So overall, the above example means \"fade this text from hue 00 (zero) to FF (255), keeping a saturation of AA (170) and a value of FF (255).

You can use these codes here too, it just requires a special symbol! For hex colours, you don't need to do anything special. If you want bright pink: accent: '{#ff00ff}' is all you need.

I\u2019m probably going to end up pissing people off with this, or completely destroying my reputation, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose, it\u2019s all been deleted by Spigot staff lmao This is mostly just me venting, I may or may not come back and refine this at some point. Everything here is my own opinion. I have nothing against any of the Spigot staff personally. <rant> Let\u2019s start with moderation. Spigot\u2019s moderation is at best outdated, and at worst abusive. It\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m transgender, and I used to spend a lot of time in the Spigot discord. There have been several occasions where people were outright bullying people like me. https://discord.com/channels/690411863766466590/694661573125472256/828984748901662740 Here\u2019s an example of one such argument that happened (notice how the messages haven\u2019t been deleted). Now I appreciate that I wasn\u2019t exactly helping the situation, but this stuff is really not okay to allow. I\u2019m just trying to live my life, is it really too much to ask to not get harassed? Out of that conversation, the only action that was taken is that kacperleague got kicked, who then immediately rejoined and kept on. On the other hand, people quite regularly get kicked or even banned for mentioning Paper. The rules are applied so inconsistently that it feels like a gamble every time you say something. Recently, my two \u2018flagship\u2019 plugins got removed from SpigotMC. Now I\u2019m not trying to say they didn\u2019t deserve to be taken down, I am in the process of introducing Adventure as a dependency, and for the time being Paper is a requirement while I work on supporting Spigot, but why do they need to immediately delete them? Those resources are literally all I had as far as my reputation went. Could they not have approached me and talked to me about it? A good platform is one where the content creators can be trusted and are on good terms with the moderators, not one where I have to compete with them. As far as ProFiles is concerned, basically I had decided to stop posting updates on SpigotMC, moving to Polymart. I was having a conversation in #general about how to go about doing it. We came to the conclusion that it\u2019d be acceptable to post a link to my Discord server: I posted an update on Spigot to trigger the plugin\u2019s update checker which did not contain a jarfile, instead just linking to the discord server. This was seemingly enough for the entire resource (not just the update) to be deleted. This links back to the concept of trust - why couldn\u2019t the staff team have approached me, pointing out that this was an issue, and we would\u2019ve worked to come up with a solution, especially when a moderator suggested doing what I did? I know I probably sound like a whiny child at the moment, but people asked for me to share my thoughts, so here they are. </rant> - Lucy __lucyy#0001 btw, massive thanks to the polymart staff, they've been really helpful and have made the transition process super easy","title":"Why i moved away from spigot"}]}
