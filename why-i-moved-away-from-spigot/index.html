<p>I’ve been asked by a few people why I decided to move away from Spigot. I’m probably going to end up pissing people off with this, or completely destroying my reputation, but I don’t care anymore. I’ve got nothing to lose, it’s all been deleted by Spigot staff lmao</p>
<p>This is mostly just me venting, I may or may not come back and refine this at some point. Everything here is my own opinion. I have nothing against any of the Spigot staff personally.</p>
<p>&lt;rant></p>
<p>Let’s start with moderation.</p>
<p>Spigot’s moderation is at best outdated, and at worst abusive. It’s no secret that I’m transgender, and I used to spend a lot of time in the Spigot discord. There have been several occasions where people were outright bullying people like me.</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/690411863766466590/694661573125472256/828984748901662740">https://discord.com/channels/690411863766466590/694661573125472256/828984748901662740</a></p>
<p>Here’s an example of one such argument that happened (notice how the messages haven’t been deleted). Now I appreciate that I wasn’t exactly helping the situation, but this stuff is really not okay to allow. I’m just trying to live my life, is it really too much to ask to not get harassed? Out of that conversation, the only action that was taken is that kacperleague got kicked, who then immediately rejoined and kept on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people quite regularly get kicked or even banned for mentioning Paper. The rules are applied so inconsistently that it feels like a gamble every time you say something.</p>
<p>Recently, my two ‘flagship’ plugins got removed from SpigotMC.</p>
<p><img alt="SpigotMC screenshots - both my plugins deleted" src="/spigot-rant-removed.png" /></p>
<p>Now I’m not trying to say they didn’t deserve to be taken down, I am in the process of introducing Adventure as a dependency, and for the time being Paper is a requirement while I work on supporting Spigot, but why do they need to immediately delete them? Those resources are literally all I had as far as my reputation went. Could they not have approached me and talked to me about it? A good platform is one where the content creators can be trusted and are on good terms with the moderators, not one where I have to compete with them.</p>
<p>As far as ProFiles is concerned, basically I had decided to stop posting updates on SpigotMC, moving to Polymart. I was having a conversation in #general about how to go about doing it. We came to the conclusion that it’d be acceptable to post a link to my Discord server:</p>
<p><img alt="SpigotMC discord extract" src="/spigot-rant-discord.png" /></p>
<p>I posted an update on Spigot to trigger the plugin’s update checker which did not contain a jarfile, instead just linking to the discord server. This was seemingly enough for the entire resource (not just the update) to be deleted.</p>
<p><img alt="SpigotMC screenshot - ProFiles deleted, &quot;no download link&quot;" src="/spigot-rant-profiles.png" /></p>
<p>This links back to the concept of trust - why couldn’t the staff team have approached me, pointing out that this was an issue, and we would’ve worked to come up with a solution, especially when a moderator suggested doing what I did? </p>
<p>I know I probably sound like a whiny child at the moment, but people asked for me to share my thoughts, so here they are.</p>
<p>&lt;/rant></p>

<p><sub>btw, massive thanks to the polymart staff, they've been really helpful and have made the transition process super easy</sub></p></div>
