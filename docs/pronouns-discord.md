### Using the bot

ProNouns Discord is currently in its early stages. When it's installed, it'll assign a Discord role to a person whenever they set their pronouns. It creates roles dynamically, all of which have zero permissions assigned. Please don't create roles manually! There's an instance running on my support server `demo.lucyy.me` (discord is at <https://support.lucyy.me>) if you'd like to have a play.

### Setup

ProNouns Discord really doesn't need much setup - it gets almost everything it needs from either ProNouns or DiscordSRV. 

There's one config setting - `command` - that indicates the command prefix used to set pronouns from discord.
