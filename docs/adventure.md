## Adventure

Plugins built on LucyCommonLib 1.4.0 and above (ProNouns 1.1.1+, ProFiles 1.0.4+) depend on 
[Adventure](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure) to provide formatting. Currently the only way to
install it is to upgrade to **a recent version of Paper** (473 or above) or a fork such as Tuinity or Purpur.

#### For the time being, CraftBukkit and Spigot aren't supported.
I am looking into ways to support these, but for the time being, stick to Paper. I can almost guarantee
that you will benefit from upgrading anyway.
