## Adventure

Plugins built on LucyCommonLib 1.4.0 and above (ProNouns 1.1.1+, ProFiles 1.0.4+) depend on 
[Adventure](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure) to provide formatting. There are a number of ways of getting Adventure depending on the version of LucyCommonLib that your plugin is built against.

### Finding the LucyCommonLib version

Plugin  | Version
------- | -------
ProNouns 1.1.1 | 1.4.1
ProNouns 1.2.0 | 1.6.1
ProFiles 1.0.4 | 1.5.0


**Ignore any letters after the number.**

### Install/update Paper (recommended, all versions)
Upgrade to **a recent version of Paper** (473 or above) or a fork such as Tuinity or Purpur.

### Install the Adventure plugin (LucyCommonLib 1.6.0+)
This method works on Spigot and CraftBukkit. I have put together a small plugin that provides Adventure. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/lucyy-mc/adventure-bukkit/releases/tag/4.7.0) and install it like any other plugin. This method may allow my plugins to run on older versions of Minecraft, but be aware no support is provided for this.
